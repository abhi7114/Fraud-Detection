# Fraud Detection

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company.

## Data Cleaning: Handling Missing Values, Outliers, and Multi-Collinearity:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify and handle missing values and outliers.
- Checked for multi-collinearity among features and performed feature engineering to improve data quality.

## Elaboration of the Fraud Detection Model:

- Split the data into training and testing sets to initiate model building.
- Implemented multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest.
- Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as AUC-ROC score, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Determined that the random forest algorithm yielded the best performance based on these evaluations.

## Answering Key Questions:

- Variable Selection:
Detailed the criteria and process for selecting variables included in the model.
- Model Performance:
Demonstrated model performance using the best set of evaluation tools and metrics.
- Key Predictive Factors:
Identified and analyzed the key factors that predict fraudulent transactions.
- Rationale Behind Predictive Factors:
Provided logical explanations for why these factors are significant in predicting fraud.
- Preventive Measures for Infrastructure Updates:
Suggested strategies for the company to adopt while updating its infrastructure to prevent fraud.
- Evaluating Implemented Actions:
Described methods to monitor and determine the effectiveness of the implemented preventive measures.
